# nlp_bleeding
Code and documents for NLP bleeding validation

This repository includes the code and resulting text file that was used in the NLP software. The query set is a list of SNOMED expressions that represent bleeding, as required for to use the CliniThink software. These were derived using an interative process- by running the software and looking for examples, and also using domain knowledge to create expressions. This code is not perfect and will evolve over time. Hopefully, we will eventually reach a point where: 1) The healthcare research/innovation arena has aggreed upon computable definitions for bleeding and 2) The healthcare data infrastructure matures and the queries can be run in any health system.

The files are:

3create_ads.py- the Python script to generate the query set.

ads_afbleedmanual_2021-10-28v1.txt- A text file generated by this script.

config_afbleedmanual_2021-10-28.ini- a config file required by the software, also generated in the script.
