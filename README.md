Code and documents for NLP bleeding validation

This repository includes the code and resulting text file that was used in the NLP software. The query set is a list of SNOMED expressions that represent bleeding, as required for to use the CliniThink software. These were derived using an interative process- by running the software and looking for examples, and also using domain knowledge to create expressions.
